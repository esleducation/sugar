As I have better thing to do than fix a f*cking poorly designed architecture
just know that the no-touch classname is injected in the Alpadia template (in the main JS file)
That allows to detect no touch device and set the hover style only on this case.
Because there is a trouble with link on iOS devices:
The first touch is for the hover, the second for the link's actions... Youhouhou

Have fun with Sugar..

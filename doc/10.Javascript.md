## Javascript

Sugar give you some javascript that can helps you for certain task like webfonts and more coming...

### Webfonts (localstorage)

Sugar allows you to store your font in localstorage to serve them a lot faster than usual. Here's how to use this feature:

#### sugar-webfonts.js

You need to integrate the sugar-webfonts.js micro file in your head (before your stylesheet etc...)

```markup
<head>
	<!-- title, metas, etc... -->
	<script src="{js}/sugar-webfonts.js"></script>
	<script>
		SugarWebfonts.init({
			version : 1, // the version of your fonts json file to detect updates
			json_path : '/fonts/fonts.json'
		});
	</script>
</head>
```

#### fonts.json

Then you need to specify your fonts in a json file like this.

```javascript
{
	"version" : 1,
	"fonts" : [{
    	"font-family" : "Open Sans",
    	"font-weight" : 400,
    	"font-style" : "normal",
    	"src" : "url(data:application/font-woff;base64,d09GRgABAAAAAE8YABIAAAAAhWwAAQABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHREVGAAABlAAAABYAAAAWABAA... format('woff')"
    }, {
    	"font-family" : "Cousine",
    	"font-weight" : "normal",
    	"font-style" : "normal",
    	"src" : "url(data:application/font-woff;base64,d09GRgABAAAAAE8YABIAAAAAhWwAAQABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHREVGAAABlAAAABYAAAAWABAA... format('woff')"
    }]
}
```

> Your source font need to be base64 encoded to be able of been stored in localstorage

#### Under the hood

Sugar webfonts will check if your fonts are in localstorage and if the version is up to date. If not, the json file will be fetched to get your fonts and store them in user localstorage. Then it will inject your fonts in the head before the page is being rendered. That will make the display of your fonts a lot quicker and avoid the font flicker effect that we all know...

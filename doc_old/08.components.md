## Components

Sugar comes with some very useful components like drawers, and many more to come.

### Drawer

Drawers are very cool. They allows you to have out of the box content that will display itself like a menu when you need it.
In sugar, the drawers are fully customizable and does not require any javascript code if you don't want.
Here's how to proceed:

**[Demo here](http://olivierbossel.github.io/sugar/demo.html#menu)**

```markup
<body>
	<!-- the input that will be responsible to display or hide the drawer -->
	<input data-drawer-toggle="menu" type="checkbox" name="menu" />
	<!-- OPTIONAL : the overlay that will be responsible to close the drawer on content click -->
	<label for="menu" data-drawer-overlay="menu"></label>
	<!-- OPTIONAL : drawer background that you can customize as you want -->
	<div data-drawer-bkg="menu"></div>
	<!-- the drawer itself -->
	<div data-drawer="menu">
		<!-- my drawer here. It can be anything you want as well -->
	</div>
	<!-- your website content -->
	<div data-drawer-content>
		<!-- my website content here -->
		<label for="menu">
			I will open the drawer when I'm clicked
		</label>
	</div>
</body>
```

```scss
// generate the drawer css
@include s-drawer('menu' push right 400px);
// support nesting
```

And that's it! You can from here customize the look and feel of your drawer as you want.

```fn
@include s-drawer( {name} , {parameters} )
```


#### parameters

name
: 	The name of your drawer
: 	@type **string**

side
: 	The side of your drawer
: 	@values **top right bottom left**

size
: 	The size of your drawer
: 	@type **number**

type
: 	The type of drawer wanted
: 	@values **push reveal slide**

method
: 	The method to open the drawer
: 	@values **translate position**


#### Target opened drawer

To target an opened drawer, sugar gives you a simple mixin to use like so:

```fn
@include s-drawer-opened( {name} );
```

```scss
[data-drawer-content] {
	@include s-drawer-opened('menu') {
		// do something on the drawer-content when it is opened
	}
}
```


#### Javascript can help

You can include a micro javascript file in your project if you don't want to write all the markup yourself. Here's how:

```markup
<head>
	<script src="{js}/drawer.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<div data-drawer="menu">
		<!-- my menu here -->
	</div>
	<div data-drawer-content>
		<!-- my website content here -->
	</div>
</body>
```

```javascript
// global
window.sugar.drawer

// es6
import { drawer } from 'sugarcss/js';
import drawer from 'sugarcss/js/drawer';
```

By adding the javascript file, sugar will create all the markup you need automatically. It will also add and remove a class called **drawer-{name}** on the body when the drawer is opened.
